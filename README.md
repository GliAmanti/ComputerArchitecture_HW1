## Following the instructions of Lab1: RV32I Simulator, you shall write RISC-V assembly programs (RV32I ISA) and output to the console with environment calls.
    + Choose one problem (A, B, or C) from Quiz1, translate it from C code to a complete RISC-V assembly program, and include the relevant test data.
    + Generate a simplified (but still informative) use case that serves as the subject for your assignment, demonstrating the practical application of the above selected problem (i.e., derived from       Problem A/B/C from Quiz1). For instance, you can create a use case that involves performing branchless counting leading zero operations on integer base-2 values titled as “Implement log2 with        branchless clz” or “Matrix multiplication using bfloat16.”
    + You are required to use only RV32I instructions (without M or F/D extensions) for floating-point data manipulation. This means you should not depend on a C compiler to generate assembly     
      routines; instead, you must write RISC-V assembly code from scratch.
    + At least 3 test data should be included in your program(s).
        + Without accepting an external data set, you can inline the predefined data.
    + Do choose a unique subject to work on, as each student should have a separate program. Starting earlier is advised to ensure you have ample time for your work.
    + Your program(s) must include loops (or recursive calls) and conditional branches, especially when writing test cases.
    + You must demonstrate iterative efforts to enhance the RISC-V programs, including reducing code size and minimizing runtime overhead, with explicit measurements.
    + Although you MUST write down your own RISC-V assembly, you can still verify the output of the C compiler’s assembly output. As a result, you are able to describe the entire program.
    + You must ensure that the program functions correctly with the Ripes simulator.
